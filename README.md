## Software Installation
Please complete the following steps to install the required software. You can skip any steps for software you already have installed if there is no stated minimum version, otherwise please ensure your version is equal to or greater than the stated minimum version of the software. If your version is less than the stated minimum version, please upgrade to the latest version as per the instructions below.

### METAMASK
Download and install MetaMask, a browser extension that you’ll use as a wallet for interacting with your smart contracts and the Ethereum network. MetaMask requires either Google Chrome or Brave browser, and also has limited support for Firefox and Opera. We recommend Chrome or Brave. 

Open your MetaMask browser extension (look for the fox symbol in your extensions on the top right of the browser), and setup your account.

Once your account is setup, change the Ethereum network that MetaMask is connected to, to the Kovan Testnet by selecting the dropdown at the top, and changing it to ‘Kovan Test Network’.
